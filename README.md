# Deauthor
This tool can remove any wireless device on your local area network with ease, if you came seeking a tool that will give you more power over your network without any administrative rights to your routers interface then this is the tool for you. 


**NOTE:**
1. This tool requires administrative privileges to run on your device.
2. This only works on devices that are wirelessly connected to your network. 


**How does it work?**
Deauthor uses the Layer 2 ARP protocol alongside that Dot11 Deauthentication frames but more on that later. Address Resolution Protocol is used to discover the hosts on your network. After all hosts have been scanned by simply selecting "Scan Network" the programs output is as follows: 

IP Address: 172.20.10.1 MAC Address: f6:0e:01:21:d0:64

It gives you the IP and MAC Address of EACH node on the network. And when entered and Deauthing has commenced the Target node will be disonnected from the network within a matter of seconds. NOTE: This only works on wireless devices as mentioned at the beginning. 
 

**What operating systems have support?**
At the current time of writing this only Linux. Though windows support can be easily added.
